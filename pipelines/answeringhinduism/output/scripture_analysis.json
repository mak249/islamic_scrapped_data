The belief of the Hindus is that the Vedas are supernatural productions. To use the technical term the Vedas are Apaurusheya i.e. made by a non-human agency.\nWhen We enquired for What is the evidence in support of this dogma?\nShockingly!  By Looking At The Evidence We see Rishis are the authors of Vedas\nCome Now let us explore the available evidence together.\nA Rishi is a poet of the Vedas. The meaning of the word\nRishi\n(ऋषि ) as given in\nNirukt\nis\nRishidarshanat\n(ऋषिर्दार्शनात), which means ‘seer’. The famous quote of Yaska Muni states that  यस्य वाक्य मस ऋषि, meaning\n‘Rishi\nis the one whose quote itself is the mantra’. This is sufficient to show that Rishis were the ones who made up the mantras.\nThis is backed up by Taittiriya Brahman (2:8:8:5) which states\n“Wise Rishis are the makers of mantras”\nThe assumption that Vedas are eternal makes many Hindus to say that Rishis were given t",

    "source_excerpt": "By – Sathyakāmā Jabala\nPart 1: The Origin of Vedas\nHow and where the Vedas originated are subjects of much debate amongst Hindu circle. The opinions are divergent. Some believe that the Vedas are millions of years old while others consider them to be not more than five thousand years old.\nWhen we read through the many articles written on this subject by Hindus themselves, we found that almost all of them assumed the Vedas to be eternal.\nHence, the question of the origin of Vedas is never dealt with properly. Those Hindus who addressed this question trivialized it, knowing well the amount of contradictory opinions within Hindu texts.\nNow will attempt to bring together whatever information get from authoritative Hindu texts regarding this issue.\nHere We Go…\nFirst let us see What Chandogya Upanishad says,\nChandogya Upanishad\nAdhyay 4, Khanda 17, Mantras1 and 2\nsays\nThe Vedas were produced from deities Agni, Vayu, and Surya\nPrajapati brooded over the worlds, and from them thus brooded on h",
