On the other hand, orthodox and mainstream Hindu representatives such as Shankarachyara of Kanchi or Shankarachyara of Puri clearly refutes such views and establishes that varna system is by birth marshalling evidence from Hindu scriptures.

The traditional description of this concept can be found in ancient scriptures like the Vishnu Smriti, Manu Smriti, Mahabharata, various Puranas, Surya Siddhanta, and others. These descriptions, while incredibly detailed, are often written in somewhat obscure language. So, instead of quoting them directly, I’ll provide an explanation in simpler terms.\nAccording to Vedic scriptures, the universe operates on a cyclical notion of time, as opposed to a linear one. In our particular region of the universe (as it is not uniform throughout), there are four major ages known as Yugas that repeat in a specific sequence. These Yugas are named Krita Yuga (also known as Satya Yuga), Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. The entire cycle of these four Yugas is referred to as a Chatur Yuga, which simply means “four Yugas,” or as a Maha Yuga, meaning “great",

But in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites, and of their not consulting Brahmanas, the following tribes of Kshatriyas have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of\nSudras\n.\n10.44.

All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of Brahman), are called\nDasyus\n, whether they speak the language of the\nMlecchas\n(barbarians) or that of the Aryans.\n",
