Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 161-126 BC) is considered the greatest astronomer of antiquity and the originator of trigonometry. Trigonometry was born in response to a scientific crisis. The Greek attempt to cast astronomy in the language of geometry was running up against the disturbing fact that the heavens are lop-sided. New tools were needed for analyzing astronomical phenomena.\nLet me paint the background to this crisis. It begins with the assumption that the earth is stationary. While this was debated in early Greek science does the earth go around the sun or the sun around the earth?- the simple fact that we perceive no sense of motion is a powerful indication that the earth does not move. In fact, when in the early seventeenth century it became clear that the earth revolves about the sun, it ",

The expansions of the sine, cosine, and arc tangent had been passed down through several generations of disciples, but they remained sterile observations for which no one could find much use. No. Calculus was not discovered in India. I am left wondering how much important mathematics is today known but not yet discovered, passed among a coterie of tightly knit disciples as an intriguing yet seemingly useless insight, lacking the context, the fertilizing connections, that would enable it to blossom and produce its fruit.\nIf Madhava of Snagagrama could not contribute as Sir Isaac Newton, it was of course not the lack of talent or brilliance but the lack of a proper culture.

In fact, bizarrely, they also accuse Britishers of creating rigid varna system or caste system. On the other hand, orthodox and mainstream Hindu representatives such as Shankarachyara of Kanchi or Shankarachyara of Puri clearly refutes such views and establishes that varna system is by birth marshalling evidence from Hindu scriptures. Equally interesting is that the fact that these orthodox and reputed spokespersons of Hinduism blame British era for weakening the traditional varna or caste sytem.  In this three-part series, Jerry Thomas weighs the arguments and points that without any iota of doubt varna system is by birth.

    "source_excerpt": "By – The Don\nLet’s begin by exploring the concept of a Yuga cycle. In Hindu Vedic cosmology, a Yuga cycle represents a recurring cycle of time. The traditional description of this concept can be found in ancient scriptures like the Vishnu Smriti, Manu Smriti, Mahabharata, various Puranas, Surya Siddhanta, and others. These descriptions, while incredibly detailed, are often written in somewhat obscure language. So, instead of quoting them directly, I’ll provide an explanation in simpler terms.\nAccording to Vedic scriptures, the universe operates on a cyclical notion of time, as opposed to a linear one. In our particular region of the universe (as it is not uniform throughout), there are four major ages known as Yugas that repeat in a specific sequence. These Yugas are named Krita Yuga (also known as Satya Yuga), Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. The entire cycle of these four Yugas is referred to as a Chatur Yuga, which simply means “four Yugas,” or as a Maha Yuga, meaning “great",

And there was neither malice, nor pride, nor hypocrisy, nor discord, nor ill-will, nor cunning, nor fear, nor misery, nor envy, nor covetousness. And for this, that prime refuge of Yogis, even the Supreme Brahma, was attainable to all. And Narayana wearing a white hue was the soul of all creatures.
