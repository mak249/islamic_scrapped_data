It has received knowledge from other civilizations and given knowledge to other civilizations. However, not everyone would agree with this assessment. For some, vedas were depository of all knowledge including mathematics and we required nothing from other civilizations. In this article, Jerry Thomas examines the evidence presented for the claim that Vedas are the depository of all knowledge or so-called vedic mathematics. We will be also briefly examining the roots of Pythagoras theorem mentioned in Sulba Sutras, the development of zero as a digit in India and evolution of trigonometry to development of infinite series of trigonometric functions in Kerala School of Mathematics to demonstrate this point. This article is thus divided into the following sectio",

In fact, he was planning 16 volumes to illustrate how vedas apply to all branches of Mathematics. Let me quotea few of the points from preface of Vedic Mathematics written by Swami Bharati Krishna. The entire preface is worth reading to understand the perspective of Swami Bharti Krishna Tirtha.(For the full preface, please refer to the Appendix 1 – Swami Bharti Krishna Tirtha Preface).  The following verbatim excerpts from Swami Bharti Krishna Tirtha’s preface might help in grasping a few key relevant points.

This was nothing less than development of a specific written symbol for nil value, emptiness, sunya, i.e. the zero. Perhaps we may venture to see in it an Indian garland thrown around the nothingness of the vacant space on the Han counting-board.

    "source_excerpt": ", 2-13, David Bressoud writes about the birth of trigonometry in Greece:\nTrigonometry arose from, and for over fifteen hundred years was used exclusively for, the study of astronomy/astrology. Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 161-126 BC) is considered the greatest astronomer of antiquity and the originator of trigonometry. Trigonometry was born in response to a scientific crisis. The Greek attempt to cast astronomy in the language of geometry was running up against the disturbing fact that the heavens are lop-sided. New tools were needed for analyzing astronomical phenomena.\nLet me paint the background to this crisis. It begins with the assumption that the earth is stationary. While this was debated in early Greek science does the earth go around the sun or the sun around the earth?- the simple fact that we perceive no sense of motion is a powerful indication that the earth does not move. In fact, when in the early seventeenth century it became clear that the earth revolves about the sun, it ",

Gold and Pingree [4] assert that by the time these series were rediscovered in Europe, they had, for all practical purposes, been lost to India. The expansions of the sine, cosine, and arc tangent had been passed down through several generations of disciples, but they remained sterile observations for which no one could find much use. No. Calculus was not discovered in India. I am left wondering how much important mathematics is today known but not yet discovered, passed among a coterie of tightly knit disciples as an intriguing yet seemingly useless insight, lacking the context, the fertilizing connections, that would enable it to blossom and produce its fruit.\nIf Madhava of Snagagrama could not contribute as Sir Isaac Newton, it was of course not the lack of talent or brilliance but the lack of a proper culture.
