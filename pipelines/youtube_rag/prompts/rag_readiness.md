# STAGE 5: RAG READINESS PROMPT

Prepare the final validated chunks for retrieval storage.

## REQUIREMENTS
- PRESERVE source video URL.
- PRESERVE timestamp range (Start - End).
- PRESERVE speaker identity (crucial for debates).
- Each chunk MUST be traceable and auditable.

## PROHIBITIONS
- DO NOT rename original IDs or source content identifiers.
- DO NOT add creative titles or synthetic metadata.
- DO NOT add subjective tags.
- DO NOT change original wording.

## FINAL CHECK
- Ensure the text is "retrieval-safe" (neutral, high-signal, accurately attributed).
