    "output": "This is one of two cases: either this man is ignorant and what he says is of no significance, or what he says is a fabrication and a lie. We Muslims know well the aayah (Qur’anic verse) in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16), — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful [al-A’raaf 7:157]&nbsp; Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: “ ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)’ – this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaa’eel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-‘Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, “Let me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] and listen to him.” I met him walking between Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming?’ The man gestured with his head to indicate ‘No’. But his son said, ‘Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah.’ [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, ‘Keep this Jew away from your brother.’ Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him.” This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth. &nbsp;It was narrated that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “I met ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr and said, ‘Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described in the Torah.’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’”&nbsp; ‘Ataa’ said: “Then I met Ka’b (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different…”&nbsp; Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “ I met ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) and said, ‘Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, ‘‘Yes, by Allah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger;&nbsp; your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’” (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125) &nbsp;Allah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). &nbsp;Allah says in Soorat Aal ‘Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:81]&nbsp; Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: It is said that Allah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (‘you must, then, believe in him and help him’)… Taawoos said: Allah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets… The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), according to the view of ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them). Allah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations. If you want to know more about the references to the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Bible (even after it has been altered!) we refer you to the books “Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Bible” and “What the Bible says about Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” by Ahmad Deedat. We ask Allah to guide you.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "If the building you describe was intended as a mosque, and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of the mosque. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and those in a state of ritual impurity.” As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing wrong with this, because Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer)… when you are in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing through a mosque)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43] And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told ‘Aa’ishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told her: “Your menstruation is not in your hand.” But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in all clean places where there is no shar’i reason not to pray. But anyone who prays there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allah is the source of strength.",

    "instruction": "Answer this Islamic question: Ruling on loving non-Muslims",
    "input": "",
    "output": "All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "If the condition of those with whom you live is as you mentioned, appealing for help from other than Allah, such as appealing for help from the dead and the non-living or the trees or stones or planets and the like, then they are committing the greatest shirk which causes expulsion from the community and faith of Islam. It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers. Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts. Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The people used to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) about goodness. And I used to ask him about evil from fear of falling in it. So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness? He said: “Yes”. So I said is their goodness after this evil? He said “Yes and it has some darkness” I said what is its darkness? He said: “A people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some.” So, I said is there any evil after that goodness? He said: “Yes, callers on the doors of Jahanam (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it.” So, I said: O Messenger of Allah describe them to us. He said: “They are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues” I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time. He said: “Adhere to the community of Muslims and their leader.” So, I said: What if there weren’t a community of Muslims nor a leader? He said: “Then seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death” Mutafaqun alayh (lit. agreed upon, i.e. narrated by both Muslim and Bukhari). Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Mohammed, his family and companions.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Among what the Islamic shari’ah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it. Additionally, in a hadith the prophet (peace be upon him) teaches: “Islam was built upon five pillars: to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah… .” It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one’s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari’ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe. It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief. As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As a result, there is great danger in this. For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity. Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence. In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet and worshipping him with Allah. Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented. It is even not permissible to write (Allah - Muhammad) on the door of the masjid, nor in other locations, due to the confusion, misrepresentation, and serious concerns described and warned of above.",

When the praying person is the leader in the prayer or praying alone, and he has a sutrah( some object like a peice of wood) in front of him, then walking across in between him and his sutrah is not permitted. However, if he is praying without a sutrah, it is not permissible to walk across in between him and his place of prostration.

    "output": "Ibn al-Qayyim said in his book \"Tuhfat al-Mawdud fi Ahkam al-Mawlud\" in the second chapter under \"What is preferred among the names and what is considered reprehensible among them\" said: “... and among them are the names of the angels such as Jibrail and Mikail and Israfil, it is makruh to name human beings with these names. Ash'had said: Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Jibril; he abhorred it and it didn't please him; al-Qai `Iyad said: \"... and others allowed it.\" Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jami' via Ma`mar: \"I said to Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Jibril or Mikail, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (la bas bi-hi)\" Regarding the hadith: \"la tusammow bi-asma al-malaikah\" (\"don't name yourselves with the names of the angels \"),&nbsp; al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih.” (\"Tuhfat al-Mawdud,&nbsp; p. 83) In al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Jibril and Mikail is not makruh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Imam Malik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makruh.” (Al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11:334) Some have stated that the meaning of Jibril is Abdullah and likewise Mikail. See Tafsir Ibn Kathir under verses numbers 97-98 in Surat al-Baqarah. Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers. The most preferred names, no doubt, are ‘ Abdullah and ‘Abdul-Rahman as has been related in the sound hadith.&nbsp; And Allah knows best.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder.\" (related by Muslim and others) and in the version of al-Haakim: \" for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting].\" (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584) Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue: it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars) it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah has cursed women who frequent graves,\" related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version, \"Allah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them.\" (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and al-Haakim) This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely. Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments: Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well. Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character. In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Al-hamdu lillaah: Every Muslim has to implement Islamic law, with all possible means, in all affairs, being social, economical, etc., in accordance with the verse: (interpretation of the meaning) \"Say: My prayer, my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah\". On certain occasions Muslims may be ruled by a non-Islamic system, which makes it very difficult for them to practice their religion. Their example may be similar to that predicted by the prophet, (peace be upon him): \" There will come a day where a Muslim holding fast to his deen (religion) is like he who is gripping a hot coal\" (Al-Tirmidhi, sahih). When a Muslim is faced with such a situation, he should hold fast to the teachings of the Qur'an, keep himself within a good Muslim community, and strive his best to implement Islam, asking Allah's forgiveness for things he could not implement. Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear\". When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of \"adversity\" or \"necessity\" (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a great rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is very sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect the corollary which says: \"The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure.\" Therefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of necessity is applicable. Some of these are: That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state of dharoorah. That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just enough to get him out of the state of dharoorah. That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the unlawful act. That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause. That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then the unlawful thing becomes lawful to him. Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above: It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and he will die if he doesn't eat It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful torturing that he cannot bear. It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, although that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions. It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance are not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one without insurance. It is permissible to complain to the \"civil courts\" (although they may not be implementing the Islamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the sound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah. Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following: It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances. Such unlawful action is not permissible under any need. Minimizing the risk, or having more convenience are not valid excuses to enter into unlawful contracts, like those involving riba. Improving the income or promoting the profits are also not valid excuses to adopt unlawful ways of earning. Let's remember that a little blessed halaal earning is better than many folds of haraam earning. Finally we have to say that it is the duty of Muslims everywhere to strive to find lawful alternatives to alleviate the state of dharoorah and save themselves from the need to adopt unlawful ways. We ask Allah to give us of His bounties what keeps us sufficed and satisfied, and not to make us in need of anyone other than Him. Ameen.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question # 61 ) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "All praises be to Allaah, Lord and Sustainer of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad&nbsp;&nbsp; (peace be upon him)&nbsp; and upon his family and companions. Dear brothers: As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah.&nbsp; It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means.&nbsp; Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a \"fee for hire\", i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done.&nbsp; Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc.&nbsp; Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this.&nbsp; Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project.&nbsp; This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds.&nbsp; This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is:&nbsp; those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it.&nbsp; Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are:&nbsp; that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds.&nbsp; However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it.&nbsp; Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal.&nbsp; In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs.&nbsp; Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity. And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct.",

    "instruction": "Answer this Islamic question: Ruling on praying in congregation in the mosque",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Praying in congregation in the mosque is obligatory for men who are able to do it, according to the correct scholarly view, based on a great deal of evidence , including the following: -1- Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you, taking precautions and carrying their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack. But there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down your arms, but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment} [an-Nisa’ 4:102]. What we conclude from this text is as follows: Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, instructed them to pray in congregation, then He repeated this instruction for the second group, by saying: {have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you}. This indicates that praying in congregation is obligatory for individuals, because Allah, may He be Glorified, did not waive that obligation from the second group when the first group did it. If praying in congregation was Sunnah (and not obligatory), then the most appropriate excuse to wave it would be fear, and if it were a communal obligation, it would be waived once the first group had done it. Thus this verse indicates that it is obligatory on every individual. Here we see three points: Allah enjoined it first; Then He enjoined it a second time; He did not grant them a concession allowing them to not do it in the case of fear. -2- The report which was soundly narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim, from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I was thinking of issuing instructions that firewood be collected, then I would issue instructions that the call to prayer be given, then I would instruct a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would leave them and go and burn the houses of some men. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of them knew that he would find a meaty bone or a sheep’s foot, he would attend `Isha’ prayer.” -3- It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are ‘Isha’ and Fajr. If they knew what there is in them, they would come even if they had to crawl. I was thinking of ordering that the iqamah for prayer be given, then I would tell a man to lead the people in prayer, and I would set out with men carrying bundles of firewood, and go to people who do not attend the prayer and burn their houses down around them.” Al-Bukhari and Muslim. -4- Imam Ahmad narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Were it not for the fact that there are women and children in the houses, I would order that the iqamah be given for `Isha’ prayer, and I would order my servants to burn down the houses with everyone in them.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do what he was thinking of because of the reason that he mentioned which prevented him from doing that, namely the fact that there were people in the houses for whom prayer in congregation was not obligatory, women and children, so if he had burned down the houses with them inside, the punishment would have included people who were not obliged to pray in congregation. -5- Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said: O Messenger of Allah, I do not have any guide to take me to the mosque. And he asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to pray in his house, and he allowed him that. When he turned to leave, he called him back and said: “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said: Yes. He said: “Then answer it.” That man was Ibn Umm Maktum. In Musnad al-Imam Ahmad and Sunan Abi Dawud it was narrated that `Amr ibn Umm Maktum said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I am a blind man whose home is far away (from the mosque) and I have a guide who is not reliable. Can you grant me a concession allowing me to pray in my house? He said: “Can you hear the call?” He said: Yes. He said: “Then I cannot grant you a concession.” When there is an instruction without qualification, it means that it is obligatory, so how about if the Lawgiver stated that there is no concession for someone who is blind, lives far away from the mosque and has a guide who is not reliable? If anyone were to have a choice between praying on his own or in congregation, the one who would be most deserving of being given this choice would be someone like this blind man. -6- It was narrated by Abu Dawud and by Abu Hatim ibn Hibban in his Sahih that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call should respond to it unless he has a valid excuse.” They said: What would constitute a valid excuse? He said: Fear or sickness; then the prayer that he does not offer in the mosque will not be accepted from him. -7- Muslim narrated in his Sahih that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly offer these prayers where the call to prayer is given, for Allah has prescribed the ways of guidance to your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and they (the prayers) are among the ways of guidance. If you pray in your houses like this one who stays away from the mosque prays in his house, you will have forsaken the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you forsake the Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who purifies himself and purifies himself well, then he goes to one of these mosques, but Allah will record one good deed for him for every step he takes, and will raise him in status one degree thereby, and will erase one bad deed thereby. I remember when no one would stay away from it but a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known, and a man would be brought staggering between two others all the way until they bring him to stand in the row. According to another version, he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us the ways of guidance, and one of the ways of guidance is praying in the mosque in which the call to prayer is given. What we conclude from this text is as follows: Staying away from praying in congregation was one of the signs of the hypocrites whose hypocrisy was well known. We ask Allah to help us to remember Him, give thanks to Him and worship Him properly. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 72398 and 40113 . And Allah knows best.",

If her 'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138). wallahu a'lam.

Al-maa'ida: 15: O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book. Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer): It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces) These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the communists, and others. Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Maa'ida: 5 This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of several cases: That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it. That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): \" and forbidden unto you is maita\" (al-Maa'ida:3) That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow\" That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) \"and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you.\" (al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would not be permisible. That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet replied \"Mention the name of Allah upon it and eat it.\"",

Al-Khiraqi (rahimahullah) said: \"If it (nisaab al-zakaat) is reached then a quarter of 1/10 is due upon it and upon whatever exceeds it, no matter how small.\" Ibn Qadama (rahimahullah) in explaining this statement said: \"Meaning that if the amount of silver has reached 200 (which is the nisaab of silver in dirhams as has been discussed in question # 64 ) and the dinars 20 (which is the nisaab for gold in the units of mathaqeel [ see also question # 64 ]) then one is obligated to pay zakaat upon it one quarter of 10 percent, as this has been established by his (the Prophet's , peace be upon him) saying 'for silver, one fourth of one tenth' \" (Al-Mughni ma'a al-sharh il-kabeer, 2/600) As for the meaning of the rest of the statement that what exceeds the nisaab no matter how small, it means that 1/4 of 1/10 (i.e. 2.5%) is also due upon this surplus difference. Thus, the overall meaning is that if monetary wealth surpasses the amount of nisaab, then zakaat is due upon it all, and not upon the surplus only, nor upon the amount of nisaab only, but on the total. Note that zakaat must be paid on the excess amount over nisaab, regardless of how small. This is the opinion taken by Malik and al-Shaafi'i and jumhoor al-ulemaa'. (see the source quoted above)",

    "output": "The answer will depend on the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and seeks their forgiveness. But if the case is the opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the following manner. Evoke in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for further elucidation). You must note, dear brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause increase in distress. And Allah knows best.",

If the owner or owners have died, then their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the Hereafter. This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin (1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan [who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is dearer to me than half of what I rule over.'

However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible. As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less. Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation. Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting. It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting. As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right.

Some scholars including Ibn Qadamah and Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his pupil Ibn al-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'ah such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan.&nbsp; Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Quran and sunnah, as in the example of Surat al-Nisa, verses 4:101-102: \"When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.\" And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to `Umar ibn al-Khattab \"Verily Allah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure.\" 'Umar said, \"[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' \" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.) Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Khalid ibn Asid said to Ibn `Umar, \"How can you shorten the prayer when Allah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,\" so Ibn `Umar said, \"O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'ahs during travel.\" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via ‘Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.) The verse expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance . Thus the Quran and sunnah mention \"travel\" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particular case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (regarding the minimum required distance).

And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102) I say: In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, \"and let the other party ...\" There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party. Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory. This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse. Second Evidence Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as \"The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused.\" (Quran 68:42-43) The evidence here is from several facets amongst them: Allah&nbsp;punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate. The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadith of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him \"do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)\"? He said yes, then the Prophet said \"fahayhala\" which means something like \"then go answer the call.\" This hadith is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered. Third Evidence Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as \"Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing\". (Quran 2:43) The proof therein is: That Allah&nbsp;ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat. His statement which was translated as \"with those that are bowing\" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation. B- Evidence From The Sunnah First Evidence Abu Huraira&nbsp;narrated that the Messenger of Allah said \"The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them.\" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version. This hadith proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah. Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadith which follow: They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadith of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer \"I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer\". This is not in contradiction to the hadith of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadith of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning. They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge. They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors: &nbsp; The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation.",

Nisab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. Nisab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.

The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days).

    "output": "Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah). This situation about which this sister is asking is a common one and occurs often as a result of a clash of desires between parents and their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest the mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, and each regards the issue from a different perspective or with a particular consideration. And perhaps the opinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one as a result of their prior trials and longer experience in life, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the appearance of the groom more than anything else, whereas the parents may look to other considerations, such as his family status, or his long-term career or employment. Of course none of this means that the womans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and preferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents stems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is accomplished, and they do not actually make the priority their daughter who is the most important thing in this issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the importance of obeying ones parents and struggling with oneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving their opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made that the following two hadeeth from the Prophet (peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, as within them are the complete answer to your question and questions from others in similar situations: The first hadeeth: If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, and the spreading of hatred) The second: Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a young woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, My father married me to his brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his standing among the people, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their will in these matters. And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her and said, My father married me to his brothers son in order to raise his standing among the people and I am unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the Prophet (peace be upon him) comes. So the Prophet (peace be upon him) came and she informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min Sunanihi and it is sahih). I ask Allah for you success and guidance to that in which there is blessings for you and your family, and may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad .",

He used to say takbeer when standing for prayer and when bowing; then he would say, \"Sami'allahu li-man hamida,\" and before prostrating he would say \"Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.\" Then he would say takbeer when prostrating and when raising his head from the prostration, then another takbeer when prostrating (for the second time), and when raising his head from the prostration.

For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she was still waiting for the end of the period. In this case, she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying , and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl. The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388).&nbsp; Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days , then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihadah (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.) Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired.

    "input": "",
    "output": "If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the person is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts (arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing the Imam’s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker returns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the Imam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam recited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people misunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when the Imam says takbeer for ruku‘ at the end of the verse and performs ruku‘, some of the followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for the prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from the ruku‘ saying “sami‘a Allahu li man hamidah”, they return back (stand up) from their prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku‘ and standing up from it. So it is incumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. This is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally lags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long supplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the majority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive obligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful. 1 However, in principle the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet (peace be upon him): The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes the takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku‘, make ruku‘. When he says “samia‘ Allahu li man hamidah” (Allah hears he who praises Him), say “Rabbanaa lakal Hamd” (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he goes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting. &nbsp; (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689)",

    "input": "",
    "output": "If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that: While the Prophet (peace be upon him) was praying towards Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of meaning): Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram. &nbsp; (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of ruku‘ in the Fajr prayer in the second rak‘ah. He shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet and his Companions) have. &nbsp; (Sahih Musim, No. 527) &nbsp;If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah. 1 For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform them of the correct direction of qiblah. If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was careless. 2 1 Al-Mughni, 1/473. 2 Al-Mughni, 1/490",

The evidence for this comes from what Imam Muslim has narrated in his Sahih: Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If iqamah is called for the prayer then there is no prayer except the obligatory one. &nbsp; (Sahih Muslim, 1/493) So, if one has performed the ruku‘ for the second rak‘ah, then he should complete the prayer, and if not, then he should discontinue because what is left from his sujud and tashahhud is not needed any more. Moreover, he should break without salaam, and it is enough to have the intention in the heart, contrary to common misconception.",

The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on “What has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation”: “He said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you.” (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami‘, No. 667) &nbsp;In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on “What has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually”: Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.”&nbsp; For more about repeating prayers, please see these answers: 90038 , 9023 , and 32680 .

As for those who were engaged with their tongue and their pen in a war against Islam by spreading distorted ideologies and doctrines, or by spreading misguided innovations and corruption, the following is incumbent upon them: Announce their repentance and renounce all that they used to spread in antagonism to Islam, in order that the renunciation becomes well known, and so that no one can claim to be misguided by their disowned writings. This renunciation is an obligation and is a precondition for the acceptance of repentance. Allah says (what means): “Save for those who repent, make amends and show clearly [what they used to say/rule wrongly], it is from those whom I accept their repentance, and I am very Forgiving, very Compassionate.” [2:160] The tafseer (explanation) for this verse indicates that it was revealed regarding the scholars of ahl ul-kitab (People of the Book) who used to conceal what had been revealed regarding the signs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the commands to believe in him. The repentant person should now engage themselves in the spread of the truth of Islam, spending their energies in defense of its teachings, and educating people in their religion. They should use their power of speech or writing to counterattack the forces of falsehood, to expose their deceits, plans and strategies, even as he used to co-operate with them in opposing Islam, and thus become a sword in the defense of Islam.

Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full hijab (women’s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations. Either the man did it by force, that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to the law of shari’ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and not the father. The man’s marriage to the woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “An adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male polytheist).” (24:3) It is also not permissible to marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not. Nonetheless, if he repents, and she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible for him to marry her and begin a new life.

The evidence for this is what Abu Dawood narrated that Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her), said, \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), used to pray with the door closed, so I arrived and asked him to open it, so he came and opened it and returned to his prayer\" (the narrator mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qibla). 1 The same is true if a mother needed, while praying, to save her child from danger or harm and the likesmall movement to the right or left, or forward or backward, does not harm the prayer. Similarly if the ridaa (upper body cover) falls off, the praying person can pick it up and if the izar (lower body cover) became loose, then he can tighten it up. The sharia (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. \" 2 Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: \"I saw Aba Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: \"If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan (satan).\" 3 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 922, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815. 2 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 921, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 814. 3 Narrated al-Bukhari Fath 1/582.",

The same if he began the prayer completely capable of performing all actions, then suddenly became unable to perform certain actions.

    "output": "The answer that is apparent is: he acts based on what is clear to him from the signs of travel on the imam from clothes or travel gear. If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the complete prayer. The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated that Ibn Abbas was asked: \"What is reason that the traveler prays two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident? So he said, that is the sunna (tradition of the Prophet ), and in another narration \"That is the sunna of Abi Al-Qasim.\" Take the case of one who assumes that the imam is a traveler, and thus prays with him two rakaat with intention of qasr. Then, after salaam (completion of prayer) with the imam, it becomes clear to him [from speaking with others after the prayer, for example] that the imam is actually a resident and that the two rakaat that he had prayed were the imam’s third and fourth. In such an instance, he should stand up and make two rakaat to complete the prayer, he makes sujood sahw (an extra two prostrations). Whatever speaking was done or questions asked to investigate do not harm his prayer. 1 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Al-Majmooa lil-Nawawi 4/356",

This is the saying of Ibn `Umar, Malik, Abu Hanifah and Ahmad in what is most well-known about this issue.&nbsp; The second opinion is that he does not repeat Maghrib. This is the saying of Ibn `Abbas, the Shafi`i School of Fiqh, and the second opinion of Ahmad’s school of Fiqh. The latter is more correct, for Allah did not make it obligatory on the person to offer a prayer twice if he has feared Allah as much as he can.

Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding ( istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)?&nbsp; The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said:&nbsp; \"If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.\" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361)&nbsp; In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays.&nbsp; Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas.&nbsp; For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy. &nbsp;(Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/292) This is based on the report of ‘Abdullah Bin Mas’ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: \"Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed \" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303) Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: \"What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.\" (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/327) Reference: “ What Should You Do in the Following Situations by Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid .",

However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred 1 . The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: \"O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl\" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said \"I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat.
