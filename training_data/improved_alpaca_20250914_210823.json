    "output": "06/Jumada al-thani/1421 , 04/September/2000 30,037 Don’t be such a fanatic! Question : 11283 What is the ruling on a person who, when he is advised with regard to an action which goes against sharee’ah, immediately says, “Don’t be such a fanatic and so extreme; be moderate.” We hope you can explain what moderation is. Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah. Whoever is advised concerning something that is haraam according to sharee’ah, so that he can avoid it or give it up, or is told of an obligation so that he can fulfil it, then he says something like this, is doing wrong. What he should do, if he is advised, is to thank the person who has offered the advice, then he should look at himself and if the advice was justified, then he should avoid the haraam thing and do what is obligatory. As far as his comment “you are a fanatic” is concerned, fanaticism, laxity and moderation are all to be understood in reference to sharee’ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah is moderate; whatever exceeds that is extreme and whatever falls short of that is laxity. The standard in all cases is sharee’ah and the meaning of moderation is that which is in accordance with the sharee’ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah is moderate.

وقد ذهب آخرون إلى هذه الدعوة \"غلق باب الاجتهاد\" لما رأوه من جراءة البعض على الأحكام الشرعية ، وصاروا يتلاعبون بالنصوص والأحكام بدعوى الاجتهاد . ولكن الموقف الصحيح تجاه هؤلاء : أن يُبين خطؤهم وتلاعبهم ، ويُكشف تزويرهم وكذبهم ، لا أن يُغلق باب الاجتهاد . وقد وضع العلماء شروطاً وضوابط للاجتهاد حتى يكون مقبولاً ، وهذه الشروط تضمن له ألا يتحول الاجتهاد إلى التلاعب بالنصوص ، فليست المسألة فوضى ، يقول مَنْ شاء ما شاء ، بل هناك شروط للاجتهاد ، يجب على المجتهد التقييد بها ، وإلا كان اجتهاده نوعاً من التلاعب والعبث . جاء في \" الموسوعة الفقهية \" ( 1 / 42 ، 43 ) : \"والذي نَدين الله عليه : أنه لا بد أن يكون في الأمة علماء متخصصون ، على علمٍ بكتاب الله ، وسنَّة رسوله ، ومواطن الإجماع ، وفتاوى الصحابة ، والتابعين ، ومن جاء بعدهم ، كما ينبغي أن يكونوا على خبرة تامة باللغة العربية التي نزل بها القرآن الكريم ، ودونت بها السنَّة النبوية ، وأن يكونوا قبل ذلك وبعد ذلك على الصراط المستقيم ، لا يخشون في الله لومة لائم ، لترجع إليهم الأمة فيما نزل بها من أحداث ، وما يجدّ من نوازل ، وألا يُفتح باب الاجتهاد على مصراعيه ، فيلج فيه من لا يحسن قراءة آية من كتاب الله في المصحف ، كما لا يُحسن أن يجمع بين أشتات الموضوع ، ويرجح بعضها على بعض . والذين أفتوا بإقفال باب الاجتهاد إنما نزعوا عن خوفٍ من أن يدَّعي الاجتهاد أمثال هؤلاء ، وأن يفتري على الله الكذب ، فيقولون هذا حلال وهذا حرام ، من غير دليل ولا برهان ، وإنما يقولون ذلك إرضاء للحكام ، ولقد رأينا بعض من يدَّعي الاجتهاد يتوهم أن القول بكذا وكذا فيه ترضية لهؤلاء السادة ، فيسبقونهم بالقول ، ويعتمد هؤلاء الحكام على آراء هؤلاء المدعين ، فقد رأينا في عصرنا هذا من أفتى بحل الربا الاستغلالي دون الاستهلاكي ، بل منهم من قال بحله مطلقاً ؛ لأن المصلحة - في زعمه - توجب الأخذ به ، ومنهم مَن أفتى بجواز الإجهاض ابتغاء تحديد النسل ، لأن بعض الحكام يرى هذا الرأي ، ويسميه \" تنظيم الأسرة \" ، ومنهم من يرى أن إقامة الحدود لا تثبت إلا على من اعتاد الجريمة الموجبة للحدِّ ، ومنهم ... ومنهم ... فأمثال هؤلاء هم الذين حملوا أهل الورع من العلماء على القول بإقفال باب الاجتهاد . ولكنا نقول : إن القول بحرمة الاجتهاد وإقفال بابه جملة وتفصيلاً لا يتفق مع الشريعة نصّاً وروحاً ، وإنما القولة الصحيحة هي إباحته ، بل وجوبه على من توفرت فيه شروطه ؛ لأن الأمَّة في حاجة إلى معرفة الأحكام الشرعية فيما جدَّ من أحداث لم تقع في العصور القديمة\" &nbsp;انتهى . وسئل علماء اللجنة الدائمة للإفتاء :&nbsp; هل يعتبر باب الاجتهاد في الأحكام الإسلامية مفتوحاً لكل إنسان ، أو أن هناك شروطاً لا بد أن تتوفر في المجتهد ؟ وهل يجوز لأي إنسان أن يفتي برأيه ، دون معرفته بالدليل الواضح ؟ فأجابوا : \"باب الاجتهاد في معرفة الأحكام الشرعية لا يزال مفتوحاً لمن كان أهلاً لذلك ، بأن يكون عالماً بما يحتاجه في مسألته التي يجتهد فيها ، من الآيات والأحاديث ، قادراً على فهمهما ، والاستدلال بهما على مطلوبه ، وعالماً بدرجة ما يستدل به من الأحاديث ، وبمواضع الإجماع في المسائل التي يبحثها حتى لا يخرج على إجماع المسلمين في حكمه فيها ، عارفاً من اللغة العربية القدر الذي يتمكن به من فهم النصوص ؛ ليتأتَّى له الاستدلال بها ، والاستنباط منها ، وليس للإنسان أن يقول في الدين برأيه ، أو يُفتي الناس بغير علم ، بل عليه أن يسترشد بالدليل الشرعي ، ثم بأقوال أهل العلم ، ونظرهم في الأدلة ، وطريقتهم في الاستدلال بها ، والاستنباط ، ثم يتكلم ، أو يفتي بما اقتنع به ، ورضيه لنفسه ديناً\" انتهى . الشيخ عبد العزيز بن باز ، الشيخ عبد الرزاق عفيفي ، الشيخ عبد الله بن غديان ، الشيخ عبد الله بن قعود . \" فتاوى اللجنة الدائمة \" ( 5 / 17 ، 18 ) . وذكر الشيخ محمد بن عثيمين رحمه الله في كتابه \"الأصول من علم الأصول\" شروط الاجتهاد ، فقال : \"للاجتهاد شروط منها : 1- أن يعلم من الأدلة الشرعية ما يحتاج إليه في اجتهاده كآيات الأحكام وأحاديثها . 2- أن يعرف ما يتعلق بصحة الحديث وضعفه ، كمعرفة الإسناد ورجاله ، وغير ذلك . 3- أن يعرف الناسخ والمنسوخ ومواقع الإجماع حتى لا يحكم بمنسوخ أو مخالف للإجماع . 4- أن يعرف من الأدلة ما يختلف به الحكم من تخصيص ، أو تقييد ، أو نحوه حتى لا يحكم بما يخالف ذلك . 5- أن يعرف من اللغة وأصول الفقه ما يتعلق بدلالات الألفاظ ، كالعام والخاص والمطلق والمقيد والمجمل والمبين ، ونحو ذلك ؛ ليحكم بما تقتضيه تلك الدلالات . 6- أن يكون عنده قدرة يتمكن بها من استنباط الأحكام من أدلتها\" انتهى . \"الأصول من علم الأصول\" (ص 85 ، 86) . وبهذه الشروط يكون الاجتهاد منضبطاً ، بعيداً عن التلاعب والهوى . والله أعلم . المراجع close المصدر : الإسلام سؤال وجواب هل لديك ملاحظة حول المحتوى؟ هل انتفعت بهذه الإجابة؟ نعم لا",

    "output": "05/ذو الحجة/1446 الموافق 01/يونيو/2025 392 ما فائدة علم مختلف الحديث؟ السؤال : 566830 ما الفائدة من علم مختلف الحديث؟ الجواب الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله، وبعد: نصوص السنة الصحيحة الثابتة، قد يفهم من ظواهر بعضها وجود اختلاف بينها في الأحكام أو الأخبار؛ إما بسبب أن الحديثين - اللذين يوهم ظاهرهما التعارض - تختلف في الحقيقة قضيتهما، وإن كانا متعلقين بالأحكام، فقد يكون الاختلاف بسبب تغير الحكم بالنسخ. فمن اكتفى بظواهر هذه الأخبار، ولم يتعمق في البحث في دلالات ألفاظها، وتاريخها، وأسباب ورودها، قد يظنها المطالع أنها متعارضة، وهذا ما يسمى بـ \"مُختلِف الحديث\". قال النووي رحمه الله تعالى: \" معرفة مختلف الحديث وحكمه: هذا من أهم الأنواع، ويضطر إلى معرفته جميع العلماء من الطوائف. وهو: أن يأتي حديثان ‌متضادان في المعنى ظاهرا، فيوفق بينهما أو يرجح أحدهما \" انتهى. \"التقريب والتيسير\" (ص90). فالموقف الشرعي في التعامل مع هذه النصوص؛ هو بالتوفيق والتأليف بين معانيها بوجه مناسب. قال الخطابي رحمه الله تعالى: \" وسبيل الحديثين إذا اختلفا في الظاهر ‌وأمكن ‌التوفيق بينهما وترتيب أحدهما على الآخر؛ أن لا يحملا على المنافاة، ولا يضرب بعضها ببعض، لكن يستعمل كل واحد منهما في موضعه، وبهذا جرت قضية العلماء في كثير من الحديث \" انتهى. \"معالم السنن\" (3 / 80). وهذا التوفيق هو الواجب. قال ابن حزم رحمه الله تعالى: \" تأليف كلام رسول اللّه صلى الله عليه وسلم وضمّ بعضه إلى بعض والأخذ ‌بجميعه -: ‌فرض لا يحلّ سواه \" انتهى. \"المحلى بالآثار\" (2/270). وأصل ذلك: أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم معصوم في تبليغ دين الله تعالى. قال الله تعالى: ( مَا ضَلَّ صَاحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَى ، وَمَا يَنْطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى ، إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَى ) النجم/2 – 4. قال ابن حزم رحمه الله تعالى: \" قال الله عز وجل عن نبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم ( وَمَا يَنْطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى ، إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَى )، وقال تعالى آمرا لنبيه عليه الصلاة والسلام أن يقول: ( إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ )، وقال تعالى ( إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ )، وقال تعالى: ( وَأَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ )، فصح أن كلام رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كله، ‌في ‌الدين: ‌وحي من عند الله عز وجل، لا شك في ذلك، ولا خلاف بين أحد من أهل اللغة والشريعة في أن كل وحي نزل من عند الله تعالى فهو ذكر منزل \" انتهى. \"الإحكام في أصول الأحكام\" (1 / 198 — 199). فنصوص السنة الصحيحة لا تتعارض، ومن ظهر له تعارض فهو في فهمه وليس في حقيقة الأمر. روى الخطيب البغدادي عن ابن خزيمة، أنه قال: \" لا أعرف أنّه رُوِي عن النّبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم حديثان ‌بإسنادين ‌صحيحين متضادّان، فمن كان عنده فليأت به حتّى أؤلّف بينهما \" انتهى. \"الكفاية في علم الرواية\" (ص432). وهذا التوفيق بين مختلف الحديث، يحقق أمرين في غاية الأهمية: الأمر الأول: أنه يحقق الفهم الصحيح لهذه النصوص، ويزيل الخلاف الحاصل بسبب سوء الفهم لها. قال ابن القيم رحمه الله تعالى: \" لا تعارض بحمد الله بين أحاديثه الصحيحة ... وأما حديثان صحيحان صريحان متناقضان من كل وجه، ليس أحدهما ناسخا للآخر، فهذا لا يوجد أصلا، ومعاذ الله أن يوجد في كلام الصادق المصدوق الذي لا يخرج من بين شفتيه إلا الحق، والآفة من التقصير في معرفة المنقول، والتمييز بين صحيحه ومعلوله، أو من القصور في فهم مراده صلى الله عليه وسلم، وحمل كلامه على غير ما عناه به، أو منهما معا، ومن هاهنا وقع من الاختلاف والفساد ما وقع، وبالله التوفيق \" انتهى. \"زاد المعاد\" (4 / 137 – 138). ولهذا المقصد ألف الإمام الشافعي كتابه \"اختلاف الحديث\"، وألف أبو جعفر الطحاوي كتابه \"شرح مشكل الآثار\". وقد قال الطحاوي رحمه الله تعالى في مقدمة كتابه: \" وإنّي نظرت في الآثار المرويّة عَنْهُ صلى الله عليه وسلم بالأسانيد المقبولة، الّتي نقلها ذوو التّثبّت فيها والأمانة عليها، وحسن الأداء لها، فوجدت فيها أشياء ممّا يسقط [=يخفى، ويغيب] معرفتها والعلم بما فيها عن أكثر النّاس، فمال قلبي إلى تأمّلها، وتبيان ما قدرت عليه من مشكِلِها، ومن استخراج الأحكام الّتي فيها، ومن نفي الإحالات عنها \" انتهى. \"شرح مشكل الآثار\" (1 / 6). و\"الإحالات\": التناقض والاضطراب. الأمر الثاني: رد الطعون التي يلقيها أولياء الشيطان، حيث يحاولون صرف الناس عن دين الاسلام، وعن السنة النبوية، بإيهامهم وجود نصوص متعارضة، وقد ظهر هذا الإفك من عصور بعيدة، ولهذا المقصد ألف ابن قتيبة الدينوري كتابه \"تأويل مختلف الحديث\". فقال رحمه الله تعالى في مقدمة كتابه مشيرا إلى سبب تأليفه: \" أمّا بعد؛ أسعدك اللّه تعالى بطاعته، وحاطك بكلاءته، ووفّقك للحقّ برحمته وجعلك من أهله؛ فإنّك كتبت إليّ تعلمني ما وقفت عليه من ثلب أهل الكلامِ أهلَ الحديثِ، وامتهانهم، وإسهابهم في الكتب؛ بذمّهم ورميهم بحمل الكذب ورواية المتناقض … \" انتهى. \"تأويل مختلف الحديث\" (ص47). الخلاصة: معرفة \"مُختلِف الحديث\"، من المباحث الهامة في علوم الشرع، فهو يتناول جميع نصوص السنة الصحيحة التي قد يوحي ظاهرها وجود اختلاف بينها، والاجتهاد في معرفة الوجه الصحيح لمعانيها والذي به يزول التعارض المتوهم. فيتحقق من هذا أمران مهمان: التفقه الصحيح في هذه النصوص ومعرفة الراجح من أقوال أهل العلم الذين اختلفوا بسبب هذا التعارض، وكذا رد طعون أهل الضلال. والله أعلم. المراجع close المصدر : موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب هل لديك ملاحظة حول المحتوى؟ هل انتفعت بهذه الإجابة؟ نعم لا",

    "output": "09/رجب/1445 الموافق 21/يناير/2024 10,855 ما هي أسباب تدوين السنة؟ السؤال : 488953 ما هي أسباب تدوين السنة؟ ملخص الجواب سبب تدوين السنة هو لحفظها من النسيان والاندثار ولنشرها بين المسلمين، وقد بدأت تتأكد هذه الحاجة للتدوين في عصر صغار التابعين ومن بعدهم في القرن الثاني الهجري، لما توسعوا في تتبع مرويات الصحابة من السنة النبوية وفتاواهم وأقضيتهم، وكذا أقوال التابعين، وبداية تطاول الأسانيد وتعددها، وتزايد انتشار المقالات والآراء المخالفة للسنة وظهور الكذب، هذا كله دفع أئمة الحديث إلى أن ينتقوا من مروياتهم ما يرونه مهما لتدوينه في مصنفات ينتفع بها المسلمون عامة وطلاب الحديث خاصة. الجواب الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله، وبعد: أولا: تدوين السنة بمعناه العام، وهو توثيق الراوي لمروياته في الصحف، قد وجد من عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم. وسببه الرئيس&nbsp;هو الاستيثاق، وحفظ المروي من النسيان. وهذا السبب من الوضوح بمالا يحتاج معه إلى تدليل واستشهاد. ومن أمثلة ذلك، ما رواه البخاري (113) عَنْ أَبي هُرَيْرَةَ، قال: \" مَا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَحَدٌ أَكْثَرَ حَدِيثًا عَنْهُ مِنِّي، إِلَّا مَا كَانَ مِنْ عَبْدِ اللهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو، فَإِنَّهُ ‌كَانَ ‌يَكْتُبُ وَلَا أَكْتُبُ\". ففي عصر الصحابة وكبار التابعين، وجد عدد ممن كان يكتب بعض مروياته، لكن لم يعتنوا بتدوين السنة بمعناه الخاص، وهو جمعها في مصنفات، كما جمع القرآن في مصحف جامع، فقد رُويت جملة من المرويات تشير إلى عدم استحبابهم جمع السنة في كتاب. وسبب ذلك راجع إلى أمرين: الأمر الأول: هو للحفاظ على القرآن الكريم&nbsp;من أن يهجر، أو أن يكتب معه شيء فيختلط به. الأمر الثاني: أن السنة يومئذ هي فقط كلام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وفعله المبيِّنان للقرآن، والسند يومئذ قصير لا يكاد يذكر، فلم تكن بالكثرة التي يعجز معها العرب عن حفظها في الصدور، وكانوا أهل حفظ، وكانوا يحرصون على الحفاظ على قوة الذاكرة بالاعتماد على الحفظ، وخاصة أن السنة لم تكن كالقرآن يُتعبد بلفظها وتلاوتها، وإنما للعمل بمعانيها، وهذا لا يُحتاج معه أن يكون كل واحد من الصحابة مطلعا على جميع السنة، بألفاظها؛ بل يكفي أن يعلم كل واحد شيئا منها، ثم يسألون بعضهم بعضا عند الحاجة. قال الشيخ عبد الرحمن المعلمي رحمه الله تعالى: \" والمقصود الشرعي منها [أي: السنة]: معانيها؛ ليست كالقرآن المقصود لفظه ومعناه؛ لأنه كلام الله بلفظه ومعناه، ومعجز بلفظه ومعناه، ومُتعبّد بتلاوته بلفظه بدون أدنى تغيير؛ لاجرم&nbsp;خفّف الله عنهم، واكتفى من تبليغ السنة غالبا: بأن&nbsp;يطّلع&nbsp;عليها بعض&nbsp;الصحابة \" انتهى من \"الأنوار الكاشفة - ضمن آثار المعلمي\" (12/43). وكان جملة منهم&nbsp;في ذلك العصر، يحدِّثون، ويطلبون سماع ما يحتاجونه للعمل، من غير توسع. قال الشيخ عبد الرحمن المعلمي رحمه الله تعالى: \" ... جاء عن ‌عمر أنه نهى عن الإكثار [من التحديث]، ومرجع ذلك إلى أمرين: الأول: استحباب ألا يكون التحديث إلا عند حضور الحاجة. الثاني: ما صرَّح به من إيثار أن لا يشغل الناس ــ يعني بسماع الأحاديث دون حضور حاجة ــ عن القرآن. وجاء عنه كما يأتي: ( أقلُّوا الرواية عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ إلا فيما يُعمل به ). و(العمل) في كلامه مطلق، يعمّ العبادات والمعاملات والآداب \" انتهى من \"الأنوار الكاشفة – ضمن آثار المعلمي\" (12/61). وهذا التصرف سهَّل عليهم حفظ ما يحتاجونه، فلم يكونوا معه بحاجة ماسَّة إلى كتاب أو مصنف، كما أن نزول القرآن شيئا فشيئا؛ سهل عليهم حفظه من غير حاجة إلى مصحف جامع. قال الخطيب البغدادي رحمه الله تعالى: \" فقد ثبت أن كراهة من كره الكتاب من الصدر الأول، إنما هي لئلا يُضاهَى بكتاب الله تعالى غيره، أو يشتغل عن القرآن بسواه، ونهي عن الكتب القديمة أن تتخذ؛ لأنه لا يُعرف حقُّها من باطلها، وصحيحها من فاسدها، مع أن القرآن كفى منها وصار مهيمنا عليها، ونهي عن كتب العلم في صدر الإسلام وجِدَّتِه؛ لقلة الفقهاء في ذلك الوقت، والمميزين بين الوحي وغيره، لأن أكثر الأعراب لم يكونوا فقهوا في الدين، ولا جالسوا العلماء العارفين، فلم يؤمن أن يلحقوا ما يجدون من الصحف بالقرآن، ويعتقدوا أن ما اشتملت عليه كلام الرحمن. وأُمر الناس بحفظ السنن؛ إذ الإسناد قريب، والعهد غير بعيد، ونهي عن الاتكال على الكتاب، لأن ذلك يؤدي إلى اضطراب الحفظ حتى يكاد يبطل، وإذا عُدم الكتاب، قوي لذلك الحفظ الذي يصحب الإنسان في كل مكان \" انتهى من \"تقييد العلم\" (ص57). وقال ابن عبد البر رحمه الله تعالى: \"&nbsp;من كره كتاب العلم، إنما كرهه لوجهين: أحدهما: ألا يتخذ مع القرآن كتاب يضاهى به. ثانيهما: ولئلا يتكل الكاتب على ما كتب فلا يحفظ فيقل الحفظ \" انتهى من \"جامع بيان العلم وفضله\" (1/292). ثانيا: لكن بعد ذلك، وخاصة في القرن الثاني الهجري: ظهرت الحاجة الماسة إلى تدوين السنة في كتب ومصنفات؛ لأن&nbsp;الحال تغيّر، وكثرت السنن في أيدي الناس؛ لأن التابعين لما رأوا الصحابة وكبار التابعين يقلون بتتابع موتهم رضوان الله عليهم؛ سعوا في تتبع مروياتهم وجمعها وحفظها. كما روى البخاري (99 م) عن عُمَر بْن عَبْدِ الْعَزِيزِ أنه كتب إِلَى أَبِي بَكْرِ بْنِ حَزْمٍ: \" انْظُرْ مَا كَانَ مِنْ حَدِيثِ رَسُولِ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَاكْتُبْهُ؛ فَإِنِّي خِفْتُ دُرُوسَ الْعِلْمِ وَذَهَابَ الْعُلَمَاءِ\". قال الشيخ&nbsp;عبد الرحمن المعلمي رحمه الله تعالى: \" والتحقيق: أنَّ بعض كبار الصحابة يرون أن تبليغ الأحاديث إنما يتعين عند وقت الحاجة، ويرون أنهم إذا بلَّغوا بدون حضور حاجة، فقد يكون منهم خطأ ما قد يؤاخذون به، بخلاف ما إذا بلَّغوا عند حضور الحاجة؛ فإنَّ ذلك متعيّن عليهم، فإما أن يحفظهم الله تعالى من الخطأ، وإما أن لا يؤاخذهم. ولهذا رُويت الأحايث عنهم كلهم، ولم يُنْقَل عن أحدٍ منهم أنه كان عنده حديث، فتحققت الحاجة إلى العمل به؛ فلم يحدّث به. وكان جماعة آخرون من الصحابة: يُحدّثون وإن لم تتحقق حاجة، يرون أن التبليغ قبل وقت الحاجة مُرغَّب فيه، لقول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: ( حدِّثوا عَنّي ولا حَرَج )؛ وغير ذلك من الأدلة الداعية إلى نشر العلم وتبليغ السُّنة. ولكلٍّ وجهة، وكلّهم على خير. على أنه لما قَلَّ الصحابة، رجحت كِفّة الفريق الثاني \" انتهى من \"الأنوار الكاشفة - ضمن آثار المعلمي\" (12/61). وهذا كحال القرآن في عصر النبوة: لم تكن هناك حاجة ماسة إلى جمعه في مصحف جامع، لكن مع تتابع وفيات القراء من الصحابة، ظهرت الحاجة إلى جمعه في مصحف جامع إمام. عَنْ عُبَيْدِ بْنِ السَّبَّاقِ، أَنَّ زَيْدَ بْنَ ثَابِتٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ، قَالَ: \" أَرْسَلَ إِلَيَّ أَبُو بَكْرٍ مَقْتَلَ أَهْلِ اليَمَامَةِ، فَإِذَا عُمَرُ بْنُ الخَطَّابِ عِنْدَهُ، قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: إِنَّ عُمَرَ أَتَانِي فَقَالَ: إِنَّ القَتْلَ قَدْ اسْتَحَرَّ يَوْمَ اليَمَامَةِ بِقُرَّاءِ القُرْآنِ، وَإِنِّي أَخْشَى أنْ يَسْتَحِرَّ القَتْلُ بِالقُرَّاءِ بِالْمَوَاطِنِ، فَيَذْهَبَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ القُرْآنِ، وَإِنِّي أَرَى أَنْ تَأْمُرَ بِجَمْعِ القُرْآنِ... \" رواه البخاري (4986). وكذلك كثرت المرويات؛ لأن السنة أصبحت تَتناول أيضا فتاوى الصحابة وأقضيتهم وتبعها كذلك أقوال وفتاوى التابعين. كما روى عبد الرزاق في \"المصنف\" (11/258) عَنْ مَعْمَرٍ، عَنْ ‌صَالِحِ ‌بْنِ ‌كَيْسَانَ قَالَ: \" اجْتَمَعْتُ أَنَا وَابْنُ شِهَابٍ وَنَحْن نَطْلُبُ الْعِلْمَ، فَاجْتَمَعْنَا عَلَى أَنْ نَكْتُبَ السُّنَنَ، فَكَتَبْنَا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ سَمِعْنَاهُ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، ثُمَّ كَتَبْنَا أَيْضًا مَا جَاءَ عَنْ أَصْحَابِهِ، فَقُلْتُ: لَا، لَيْسَ بِسُنَّةٍ، وَقَالَ هُوَ: بَلَى، هُوَ سُنَّةٌ، فَكَتَبَ وَلَمْ أكتُبْ، فَأَنْجَحَ وَضَيَّعْتُ\". ثم بدأت الأسانيد تطول، وتتعدد، لتعدد الرواة. وانضاف إلى هذا انتشار جملة من مقالات أهل البدع، وانتشار التوسع في القول بالرأي، وظهور الكذب في الراوية. فدفع هذا كله أئمة الحديث والسنة إلى جمع ما عندهم من السنن في مصنفات خاصة؛ لحفظ السنة ونشرها بين الناس. قال الخطيب البغدادي رحمه الله : \" إنما اتسع الناس في كَتْب العلم، وعولوا على تدوينه في الصحف، بعد الكراهة لذلك؛ لأن الروايات انتشرت، والأسانيد طالت، وأسماء الرجال وكناهم وأنسابهم كثرت، والعبارات بالألفاظ اختلفت، فعجزت القلوب عن حفظ ما ذكرنا ... \" انتهى. \"تقييد العلم\" (ص64). وقال الحافظ ابن حجر رحمه الله تعالى: \" اعلم، علمني الله وإياك؛ أن آثار النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم لم تكن في عصر أصحابه وكبار تَبَعِهم مدونة في الجوامع، ولا مرتبة؛ لأمرين: أحدهما: أنهم كانوا في ابتداء الحال قد نهوا عن ذلك، كما ثبت في صحيح مسلم؛ خشية أن يختلط بعض ذلك بالقرآن العظيم. وثانيهما: لسعة حفظهم وسيلان أذهانهم. ولأن أكثرهم كانوا لا يعرفون الكتابة. ثم حدث في أواخر عصر التابعين: تدوين الآثار، وتبويب الأخبار؛ لما انتشر العلماء في الأمصار، ‌وكثر ‌الابتداع من الخوارج والروافض ومنكري الأقدار. فأول من جمع ذلك الربيع بن صبيح وسعيد بن أبي عروبة … \" انتهى من \"هدي الساري\" (ص6). هذا من حيث السبب العام، ثم قد توجد هناك أسباب خاصة، فصاحب كل مصنف هناك دافع خاص على أساسه اختار طريقة تصنيفه، كما هو مشهور عن سبب تصنيف البخاري لـ \"الجامع الصحيح\". قال الحافظ ابن حجر رحمه الله تعالى: \" قال أبو عبد الله محمد بن إسماعيل البخاري: كنا عند إسحاق بن راهويه فقال: لو جمعتم كتابا مختصرا لصحيح سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم؟ قال: فوقع ذلك في قلبي؛ فأخذت في جمع الجامع الصحيح ... \" انتهى من \"هدي الساري\" (7). وكما روى أبو موسى المديني في \"خصائص مسند الإمام أحمد\" (ص14): \" عن عبد الله بن أحمد بن حنبل يقول: \" قلت لأبي رحمه الله تعالى: لم كرهت وضع الكتب وقد عملت المسند؟ فقال: ‌عملت ‌هذا ‌الكتاب ‌إماما؛ إذا أختلف الناس في سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رُجِع إليه \" انتهى. والله أعلم. المراجع close المصدر : موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب هل لديك ملاحظة حول المحتوى؟ هل انتفعت بهذه الإجابة؟ نعم لا",

    "output": "27/جمادى الثانية/1445 الموافق 09/يناير/2024 8,301 هل تدبر القرآن فرض؟ السؤال : 312089 هل تدبر القرآن الكريم فرض؟ الجواب الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله، وبعد: أولًا: جاء مصطلح (التدبر) في الاستعمال القرآني في سياق بيان \"الحكمة\" من إنزال الكتاب، والغاية التي دُعي الناس إليها. قال سبحانه: (كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ) [ص: 29]. وهذه الآية عامة، في حق الناس جميعا. ولأجل ذلك، وردت الدعوة عامة للمشركين، أن يتدبروا كتاب الله، ويستدلوا على عظيم إحكامه، وعالي بيانه، على صدق مجيئه من عند رب العالمين. قال سبحانه: (أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا) [النساء: 82]. ووقع الذم الشديد لمن أعرض عن \"تدبر\" القرآن، وتفهم معانيه؛ الأمر الذي حرمهم أنوار هداياته، وأبقاهم في الشرك وظلماته: قال الله تعالى: ( أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَى قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا ) محمد/24 قال ابن عاشور، رحمه الله: \" والمعنى: أن الله خلقهم بعقول غير منفعلة بمعاني الخير والصلاح فلا يتدبرون القرآن مع فهمه أو لا يفهمونه عند تلقيه وكلا الأمرين عجيب . والاستفهام تعجيب من سوء علمهم بالقرآن ومن إعراضهم عن سماعه\". انتهى، من \"التحرير والتنوير\" (26/113). وقال الشيخ السعدي، رحمه الله: \"أي: فهلا يتدبر هؤلاء المعرضون لكتاب الله، ويتأملونه حق التأمل، فإنهم لو تدبروه، لدلهم على كل خير، ولحذرهم من كل شر، ولملأ قلوبهم من الإيمان، وأفئدتهم من الإيقان، ولأوصلهم إلى المطالب العالية، والمواهب الغالية، ولبين لهم الطريق الموصلة إلى الله، وإلى جنته ومكملاتها ومفسداتها، والطريق الموصلة إلى العذاب، وبأي شيء تحذر، ولعرفهم بربهم، وأسمائه وصفاته وإحسانه، ولشوقهم إلى الثواب الجزيل، ورهبهم من العقاب الوبيل. أَمْ عَلَى قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا أي: قد أغلق على ما فيها من الشر وأقفلت، فلا يدخلها خير أبدا؟ هذا هو الواقع\" انتهى، من \"تفسير السعدي\" (788). ثانيا: تدور المعاني التي يذكرها علماء التفسير للتدبر حول معناه اللغوي، وهو: النظر في عاقبة الكلام، وإحسان التأمل فيه. قال \"ابن منظور\": \"ودبَّر الأمر وتدبَّره: ‌نظر ‌في ‌عاقبته .. والتدبير في الأمر: أن تنظر إلى ما تؤول إليه عاقبته، والتدبر: التفكر فيه\"، انتهى. \"لسان العرب\": (4/ 273). وفي جمع دلالات معنى \"التدبر\" في اللغة، يقول \"ابن القيم\": عن التدبر \"... لأنه نظرٌ في أدبار الأمور، وهي أواخرُها وعواقبُها. ومنه: تدبُّر القول، قال تعالى: أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ ، وقال: أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا . وتدبُّرُ الكلام أن ينظرَ في أوَّله وآخره، ثمَّ يعيدَ نظره مرَّةً بعد مرَّة؛ ولهذا جاء على بناء ‌التفعُّل، ‌كالتجرُّع والتفهُّم والتبيُّن\"، انتهى. \"مفتاح دار السعادة ومنشور ولاية العلم والإرادة\" (1/ 525). وتدبر القول عند علماء التفسير يدور حول: \"إعمال الفكر، والنظر، والتأمل، والتفهم في آي القرآن الكريم، للوصول إلى معانيه ومقاصده، والعمل بما فيه\". انظر: \"تدبر القرآن\" للتويجري: (41). ثانيًا: ينبغي أن يُعلم أن التدبر في القرآن على درجات ومراتب، فبحسب ما يؤتيه الله للإنسان من علوم ومعارف = تكون استفادته من القرآن. قال ابن القيم: \" والمقصود تفاوت الناس في مراتب الفهم في النصوص، وأن منهم من يفهم من الآية حكمًا أو حكمين، ومنهم من يفهم منها عشرة أحكام أو أكثر من ذلك، ومنهم من يقتصر فهمُه على مجرد اللفظ؛ دون سياقه، ودون إيمائِه وإشارته وتنبيهِه واعتباره. وأخص من هذا وألطف: ضمه إلى نص آخر متعلق به؛ فيَفهم من اقترانه به قدرًا زائدًا على ذلك اللفظ بمفرده، وهذا باب عجيب من فهم القرآن، لا يَنْتبه له إلا النادر من أهل العلم، فإن الذهن قد لا يشعر بارتباط هذا بهذا، وتعلقه به\"، انتهى من \" أعلام الموقعين\"(3/126). ثالثا: قد حصل نوع من أنواع الشطط في مفهوم \"التدبر\" عند المعاصرين، وبعضهم حصره في استخراج المعاني الغامضة، واللطائف، والنكات الدقيقة، وهذا حصر لمفهوم واسع، بل إن من أولى ما يستخرجه الإنسان من تدبره لكتاب الله، هو: العمل به. يقول د. خالد السبت: \"فإن من الشطط أن تتوجه الأذهان عند الحديث عن التدبر إلى استخراج المعاني واللطائف والنكات الدقيقة التي لم نسبق إليها!! فإن ذلك لا يصلح إلا للعلماء، لكنَّ المؤمن يتدبر ليرقق قلبه، ويتعرف على مواطن العبر، ويعرض نفسه على ما ذكره الله في القرآن من أوصاف المؤمنين، ويحذر من الاتصاف بصفات غيرهم، إلى غير ذلك مما ينتفع به، ويمكن حصوله لكل من تدبر كتاب الله تعالى\"، انتهى، \" الخلاصة، خالد السبت \": (36). وليحذر المرء من القول في كتاب الله بغير علم، فإن الله حين شرع التدبر للناس، لم يشرع لهم أن يتجرؤوا على كتابه، بل هذا أمر لهم بتحصيل الآلة المعينة على هذا التدبر. وانظر مقالة:&nbsp; التدبُّر&nbsp;والتحرُّر من أَسْر اللطائف القرآنية !، للأستاذ محمد مصطفى عبد المجيد. رابعاً: أما عن حكم التدبر، فإن النصوص الواردة عن أهل العلم جاءت مطلقة مصرحة بالوجوب دون تفصيل، كما قال ابن حزم في رسائله: \"تدبر القرآن فرض\"، انتهى، \"رسائل ابن حزم\" (3/ 198). وانظر نصوصًا أخرى في \"تدبر القرآن\"، عبد اللطيف التويجري، (59 - 61). لكن ينبغي أن نفرق بين مراتب وجوب التدبر على كل إنسان، فكل إنسان يجب عليه أن يتدبر القرآن حسب وسعه وطاقته، وفهمه وقدراته وطاقاته الإدراكية. قال \"ابن تيمية\": \" معرفة ما جاء به الرسول على التفصيل: فرض على الكفاية؛ فإن ذلك داخل في تبليغ ما بعث الله به رسوله، وداخل في تدبر القرآن وعقله وفهمه، وعلم الكتاب، والحكمة، وحفظ الذكر، والدعاء إلى سبيل الرب بالحكمة والموعظة الحسنة، والمجادلة بالتي هي أحسن، ونحو ذلك مما أوجبه الله على المؤمنين فهو واجب على الكفاية منهم. وأما ما يجب على أعيانهم: فهذا يتنوع بتنوع قدرهم، ومعرفتهم، وحاجتهم، وما أمر به أعيانهم فلا يجب على العاجز عن سماع بعض العلم، أو عن فهم دقيقه ما يجب على القادر على ذلك، ويجب على من سمع النصوص وفهمها، من علم التفصيل: ما لا يجب على من لم يسمعها، ويجب على المفتي، والمحدث، والمجادل ما لا يجب على من ليس كذلك \"، انتهى، \"مجموع الفتاوى \" (3/ 312). فالحاصل أن تدبر القرآن منه: 1- ما هو واجب على المكلف. وهو ما يتعلق بمعرفة الله، ومعرفة رسوله ودينه، مما لا يصح له إيمانه ودينه من دونه. 2- ومنه ما هو واجب على الكفاية. وهو ما يختص أهل العلم به، مما يتعلق بفهم كتاب الله، ودينه وشرعه، على التفصيل، وإقامة ذلك في الأمة، علما، وعملا. 3- ومنه ما هو على الاستحباب. وهو غالب ما يدعو الناس إليه في هذه الأيام؛ شريطة أن يستقيم على النظر الصحيح، والمنهج السديد في الفهم والتأويل؛ لا ما يشتط به الفهم والقول، وما يخرج على غير أصل متين. انظر: \"مقرر تدبر القرآن\"، إشراف: العواجي، (99 - 110)، \"تدبر القرآن\" للتويجري: (59 - 63). والله أعلم. المراجع close المصدر : موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب هل لديك ملاحظة حول المحتوى؟ هل انتفعت بهذه الإجابة؟ نعم لا",

    "output": "30/رجب/1446 الموافق 30/يناير/2025 1,654 هل معاني القران مطلقة؟ السؤال : 538270 سمعت أحد القراء يقول: إن معاني كلمة واحدة في القرآن لا حد لها؛ لأن القرآن صفة الله تعالى، وكما إن الله تعالى ليس له نهاية فصفته ليس لها نهاية، فهل هذا القول صحيح؟ وإن كان الجواب نعم، فكيف نوفق بين ذلك وبين الآيات المحكمات التي معناها مبين؟ الجواب الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله، وبعد: أولًا: القرآن الكريم آياته محكمة ومفصَّلة، قد بيَّن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلَّم لأصحابه معناه وموضع الحجة فيه على البشر، كما بيَّن لفظه، سواء. \"فإنه سبحانه وتعالى جعل القرآن نورًا وهدى، وبيانًا للناس، وشفاءً لما في الصدور، وأرسل الرسل ليبين للناس ما نُزِّل إليهم، وليحكم بين الناس فيما اختلفوا فيه، ولئلا يكون للناس على الله حجة بعد الرسل\"، انتهى من \"مجموع الفتاوي\" لابن تيمية (6/361). ويقول شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية: \"وقوله تعالى {كِتَابٌ أُحْكِمَتْ آيَاتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ} فقد فصَّله بعد إحكامه؛ بخلاف من تكلم بكلام لم يُحْكِمه، وقد يكون في الكلام المحكم ما لم يبينه لغيره؛ فهو سبحانه أحكم كتابه، ثم فصَّله وبيَّنه لعباده، كما قال: {وَكَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ سَبِيلُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ} وقال: {وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَاهُمْ بِكِتَابٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ}، فهو سبحانه بيَّنه وأنزله على عباده بعلمٍ، ليس كمن يتكلَّم بلا علم\"، انتهى من \"مجموع الفتاوي\" (15/106). ويقول أيضًا: \"النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بيَّن لأصحابه القرآنَ؛ لفظَه ومعناه جميعًا، فإن البيان لا يحصل بدون هذا\"، انتهى من \"جواب الاعتراضات المصرية على الفتيا الحموية\" (ص11). وقال ابن القيم: \"فكما بلَّغ الرسول ألفاظ القرآن للأمة؛ بلَّغهم معانيه، بل كانت عنايته بتبليغ معانيه أعظم من مجرد تبليغ ألفاظه، ولهذا وصل العلم بمعانيه إلى من لم يصل إليه حفظ ألفاظه، والنقل لتلك المعاني أشد تواترا وأقوى اضطرارًا، فإن حفظ المعنى أيسر من حفظ اللفظ، وكثير من الناس يعرف صورة المعنى ويحفظها، ولا يحفظ اللفظ، والذين نقلوا الدين عنه علموا مراده قطعًا، لما تلا عليهم من تلك الألفاظ\"، انتهى من \"الصواعق المرسلة\" (2/636). وهذا البيان يشمل معاني المحكم، ومعاني المتشابه، وهو الذي يشتبه على كثير من الناس أو بعضهم، ويعرفه الراسخون في العلم بردِّه إلى المحكم. قال ابن كثير رحمه الله: \"يخبر تعالى أن في القرآن آياتٍ محكماتٍ هن أم الكتاب؛ أي بينات واضحات الدلالة لا التباس فيها على أحد، ومنه آيات أخر فيها اشتباه في الدلالة على كثير من الناس، أو بعضهم، فمن ردَّ ما اشتبه إلى الواضح منه، وحكَّم محكمَه على متشابهه عنده؛ فقد اهتدى، ومن عكس انعكس، ولهذا قال تعالى: {هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ}، أي: أصله الذي يُرجَع إليه عند الاشتباه، {وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ}، أي: تحتمل دلالتها موافقة المحكَم، وقد تحتمل شيئًا آخر من حيث اللفظ والتركيب، لا من حيث المراد\"، انتهى من \"تفسيره\" (2/6). ثانيًا: المعنى المذكور في السؤال، قد ذكره بعض أهل العلم، ومعناه عندهم لا يتعارض مع قيام الحجة بالقرآن، ببلوغ معانيه ومواضع الحجة منه إلى الناس، لكن مرادهم بذلك: أنه لا مطمع في استقصاء فوائد القرآن وما أودعه الله فيه من دلائل وهدايات وعجائب ليس لها نهاية فهي لا تنقضي، وفوائد القرآن كثيرة عظيمة لا تقتصر على موضع الحجة الواجبة القائمة على الناس. ويذكر بعض العلماء أنَّ استقصاء كل الفوائد القرآنية وفهمها وبلوغ آخرها؛ غيرُ ممكن، لأنها لا غاية ولا نهاية لها، كما أنه لا نهاية للمتكلم بالقرآن سبحانه وتعالى، وقد نُقل هذا المعنى عن سهل بن عبد الله التستري رحمه الله. قال أبو الحسن الواحدي: \"وكلٌّ ينفق مما رزقه الله، ويعمل على مقدار ما وفقه الله، ومتى يبلغ ضَعف سعينا وقاصر جهدنا نهاية ما لا يتناهى؟! وهذا سهل بن عبد الله يقول: لو أعطي العبد بكل حرف من القرآن ألف فهم؛ لم يبلغ نهاية ما أودع الله في آية من كتابه، لأنه كلام الله، وكلامه صفته، وكما أن ليس لله نهاية؛ فكذلك لا نهاية لفهم كلامه، وإنما يَفهم كلٌّ بمقدار ما يفتح الله على قلبه. وكلام الله غير مخلوق، ولا يبلغ إلى نهاية فهمه فهومٌ محدثةٌ مخلوقة\"، انتهى من \"التفسير البسيط\" (1/394). ويقول الزركشي في \"البرهان في علوم القرآن\" (2/155): \"فهم كلام الله تعالى لا غايةَ له، كما لا نهايةَ للمتكلِّم به، فأمَّا الاستقصاءُ فلا مطمع فيه للبشر، ومن لم يكن له علمٌ وفهمٌ وتقوى وتدبُّر؛ لم يدرك من لذة القرآن شيئًا\"، انتهى. فمراد العلماء بذلك أنه لا يُستقصى ما أودعه الله تعالى في كتابه من أنواع البراهين، وصنوف الهداية وأسرارها، أي: لا يبلغ أحد الإحاطة بجميع ذلك حتى يبلغ النهاية فلا يبقى معنى إلا فهمَه وأدركَه. وهذا لا يتعارض مع قيام الحجة، بفهم معانيه المحكمة المفصلة التي جعلها الله حجة على العباد، فليس لهم حجة على الله بعدها، لأن فهم الحجة هو أول الفهم وأصله، وهو المعنى المطابق للآية، ويبقى بعده كثير من الفوائد والأحكام والنكت والاستنباطات. وهذا نحو قول العلماء عن القرآن: (لا تنقضي عجائبه)، قال الشيخ ابن عثيمين رحمه الله: \"قوله: (ولا تنقضي عجائبه)؛ لا تنقضي عجائبه لمن أعطاه الله تعالي فهمًا لكتابه، فإنه يتذوق فيه المعاني العظيمة الكثيرة، أما المعرض عنه فإنه قد لا يرى فيه عجبًا واحدًا، لكننا هنا نصف القرآن من حيث هو قرآن، بقطع النظر عن القارئ\"، انتهى من \"شرح مقدمة التفسير\" لابن تيمية (ص12). وقال ابن القيم: \"والمقصود تفاوت الناس في مراتب الفهم في النصوص، وأن منهم من يفهم من الآية حكمًا أو حكمين، ومنهم من يفهم منها عشرة أحكام أو أكثر من ذلك، ومنهم من يقتصر فهمُه على مجرد اللفظ؛ دون سياقه، ودون إيمائِه وإشارته وتنبيهِه واعتباره\"، انتهى من \"أعلام الموقعين\" (2/188). فإذا خرج الكلام في السؤال مخرج هذه المعاني المنقولة عن العلماء، فهو صحيح، وأما القرآن فكلماته وحروفه معدودة محددة، ومعانيه التي تقوم بها الحجة معلومة مبيَّنة، والحجة قائمة على العباد بالقرآن، لفظه ومعانيه، وكل ذلك منقول عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كما سبق. والله أعلم. المراجع close المصدر : موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب هل لديك ملاحظة حول المحتوى؟ هل انتفعت بهذه الإجابة؟ نعم لا",
