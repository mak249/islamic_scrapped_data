Question: Should he give up his place in the Hajj lottery to his father even though he has not yet done the obligatory Hajj?

Answer: 01/Dhu al-Hijjah/1435 , 25/September/2014 7,736 Question : 199427 I am a young, married Algerian man, and I have not yet done the obligatory Hajj. Allah has blessed me this year, and my name was drawn from the lottery of people who have registered for Hajj in our country. It is well-known that spots are limited, and I was very happy, but my father wants to go in my place. My question is: Should I go or should I let my father go in my place, by way of honouring my parents? Is it more important to fulfil this pillar of Islam or to honour one’s parents? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: Firstly: It is obligatory to do Hajj immediately; once a person is able and has the means to do Hajj, he must hasten to do it, and it is not permissible for him to delay it. This is the view of the majority of scholars. See the answer to question no. 41702 Secondly: In the answer to question no. 132011 we stated that giving up an opportunity to someone else with regard to acts of worship is of two types: 1.In the case of an obligatory act of worship, it is not permissible to give precedence to someone else with regard to it 2.In the case of a recommended (mustahabb) act of worship, it is more appropriate not to give precedence to someone else, but if there is an interest or purpose to be served by doing that, then there is nothing wrong with it. As you have not previously done the obligatory Hajj, and Allah has made it easy for you this year to have your name drawn in the Hajj lottery, then what you must do is perform Hajj on your own behalf, because the obligatory Hajj is one of the obligatory duties and pillars of Islam, and it is obligatory upon the one who is able to do it. The means of being able to do it have become available to you, so you must fulfil this obligatory duty towards Allah, may He be exalted, and it is not permissible for you to give precedence to your father in the lottery, because giving precedence to someone else with regard to obligatory acts of worship is not permissible, as stated above. You have to speak to your father gently and apologise, and explain to him the Islamic rulings on this matter. Performing this important pillar of Islam takes precedence over honouring one’s parents if there is a conflict between the two, and that does not come under the heading of disobedience to parents; you can honour your father in other ways. But if you go against that and you give your father precedence over yourself, and he goes for Hajj instead, then his Hajj is valid, but you must hasten to perform Hajj as soon as you are able to. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: is it permissible for a person to send his parents for Hajj before he goes for Hajj himself? They replied: Hajj is obligatory for every free, adult Muslim of sound mind who is able to perform it, once in a lifetime. Honouring one’s parents and helping them to do the obligatory duty is something that is prescribed to the extent that one is able. However you have to do Hajj for yourself first, then you can help your parents, if it was not possible for all of you to do Hajj together. But if you give your parents precedence over yourself, their Hajj is valid. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/70-71) And Allah knows best.

Title: Is it better to do Hajj on behalf of the deceased or to use that money to set up ongoing charity on his behalf?

Question: Is it better to do Hajj on behalf of the deceased or to use that money to set up ongoing charity on his behalf?

Answer: 09/Dhu al-Qi'dah/1443 , 08/June/2022 5,127 Question : 199368 There is a seventy-year-old man who did Hajj, and he wants to do Hajj on behalf of his mother who died without having done Hajj, as she could not afford to do Hajj. And he wants to do Hajj on behalf of his wife who died and was not able to afford to do Hajj from her own money, but her husband was able to pay the costs of Hajj for her. My question is: in view of his health and advanced age, is it better for him to do Hajj on behalf of his mother and then on behalf of his wife, or to use that money to set up ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah) and intend it to be on their behalf? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: One of the ways in which a person may honour his parents and show kindness to his wife is to strive to do that which will raise them in status and increase their good deeds after they die. If the questioner has the choice between doing Hajj on their behalf or giving money in charity on their behalf, we suggest that he should begin with Hajj. So he should start by doing Hajj on behalf of his mother, then doing Hajj on behalf of his wife, doing that himself or paying the costs of Hajj for someone who will do it on their behalf, if he is not able to do Hajj. That is because of the immense reward for Hajj, and because it may have been obligatory for them, if they were able to do it at any time during their lifetime, even if that was when they were young. So doing Hajj on their behalf himself will discharge their duty, and if he is able to pay the costs for two people to do Hajj on their behalf in the same year, that would be a good idea. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Which is better, to do Hajj on behalf of one who has passed away, or to give that money in charity to those who are in need? He replied: If the deceased did not do the obligatory Hajj, then undoubtedly appointing someone to do Hajj on his behalf is better, because it is fulfilling an obligatory duty. But if it is a supererogatory Hajj, then he should work out what will serve the greater interest. If people are in severe need and there is a famine, then giving charity is better, otherwise doing Hajj on behalf of that deceased person is better." Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa 21/263). Then if he has money available after that, and Allah has made him well off and he wants to give charity on behalf of both of them, then he may set up ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), even if it is small, and he can include himself, his parents and his wife in that, such as contributing to the building of a mosque, or the digging of a well, or the setting up of a waqf (endowment) to help the needy, and the like. Note: With regard to what is mentioned in the question, “but her husband was able to pay the costs of Hajj for her,” we would like to point out that it is not obligatory for the husband to cover the costs of Hajj for his wife, even if he is rich. Rather that is recommended and he will be rewarded for it, and it comes under the heading of showing kindness to her. But if he does not do that, there is no sin on him.
