Title: Should he give up his place in the Hajj lottery to his father even though he has not yet done the obligatory Hajj?

Question: Should he give up his place in the Hajj lottery to his father even though he has not yet done the obligatory Hajj?

Answer: 01/Dhu al-Hijjah/1435 , 25/September/2014 7,736 Question : 199427 I am a young, married Algerian man, and I have not yet done the obligatory Hajj. Allah has blessed me this year, and my name was drawn from the lottery of people who have registered for Hajj in our country. It is well-known that spots are limited, and I was very happy, but my father wants to go in my place. My question is: Should I go or should I let my father go in my place, by way of honouring my parents? Is it more important to fulfil this pillar of Islam or to honour one’s parents? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: Firstly: It is obligatory to do Hajj immediately; once a person is able and has the means to do Hajj, he must hasten to do it, and it is not permissible for him to delay it. This is the view of the majority of scholars. See the answer to question no. 41702 Secondly: In the answer to question no. 132011 we stated that giving up an opportunity to someone else with regard to acts of worship is of two types: 1.In the case of an obligatory act of worship, it is not permissible to give precedence to someone else with regard to it 2.In the case of a recommended (mustahabb) act of worship, it is more appropriate not to give precedence to someone else, but if there is an interest or purpose to be served by doing that, then there is nothing wrong with it. As you have not previously done the obligatory Hajj, and Allah has made it easy for you this year to have your name drawn in the Hajj lottery, then what you must do is perform Hajj on your own behalf, because the obligatory Hajj is one of the obligatory duties and pillars of Islam, and it is obligatory upon the one who is able to do it. The means of being able to do it have become available to you, so you must fulfil this obligatory duty towards Allah, may He be exalted, and it is not permissible for you to give precedence to your father in the lottery, because giving precedence to someone else with regard to obligatory acts of worship is not permissible, as stated above. You have to speak to your father gently and apologise, and explain to him the Islamic rulings on this matter. Performing this important pillar of Islam takes precedence over honouring one’s parents if there is a conflict between the two, and that does not come under the heading of disobedience to parents; you can honour your father in other ways. But if you go against that and you give your father precedence over yourself, and he goes for Hajj instead, then his Hajj is valid, but you must hasten to perform Hajj as soon as you are able to. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: is it permissible for a person to send his parents for Hajj before he goes for Hajj himself? They replied: Hajj is obligatory for every free, adult Muslim of sound mind who is able to perform it, once in a lifetime. Honouring one’s parents and helping them to do the obligatory duty is something that is prescribed to the extent that one is able. However you have to do Hajj for yourself first, then you can help your parents, if it was not possible for all of you to do Hajj together. But if you give your parents precedence over yourself, their Hajj is valid. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/70-71) And Allah knows best.

Title: Is it better to do Hajj on behalf of the deceased or to use that money to set up ongoing charity on his behalf?

Question: Is it better to do Hajj on behalf of the deceased or to use that money to set up ongoing charity on his behalf?

Answer: 09/Dhu al-Qi'dah/1443 , 08/June/2022 5,127 Question : 199368 There is a seventy-year-old man who did Hajj, and he wants to do Hajj on behalf of his mother who died without having done Hajj, as she could not afford to do Hajj. And he wants to do Hajj on behalf of his wife who died and was not able to afford to do Hajj from her own money, but her husband was able to pay the costs of Hajj for her. My question is: in view of his health and advanced age, is it better for him to do Hajj on behalf of his mother and then on behalf of his wife, or to use that money to set up ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah) and intend it to be on their behalf? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: One of the ways in which a person may honour his parents and show kindness to his wife is to strive to do that which will raise them in status and increase their good deeds after they die. If the questioner has the choice between doing Hajj on their behalf or giving money in charity on their behalf, we suggest that he should begin with Hajj. So he should start by doing Hajj on behalf of his mother, then doing Hajj on behalf of his wife, doing that himself or paying the costs of Hajj for someone who will do it on their behalf, if he is not able to do Hajj. That is because of the immense reward for Hajj, and because it may have been obligatory for them, if they were able to do it at any time during their lifetime, even if that was when they were young. So doing Hajj on their behalf himself will discharge their duty, and if he is able to pay the costs for two people to do Hajj on their behalf in the same year, that would be a good idea. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Which is better, to do Hajj on behalf of one who has passed away, or to give that money in charity to those who are in need? He replied: If the deceased did not do the obligatory Hajj, then undoubtedly appointing someone to do Hajj on his behalf is better, because it is fulfilling an obligatory duty. But if it is a supererogatory Hajj, then he should work out what will serve the greater interest. If people are in severe need and there is a famine, then giving charity is better, otherwise doing Hajj on behalf of that deceased person is better." Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa 21/263). Then if he has money available after that, and Allah has made him well off and he wants to give charity on behalf of both of them, then he may set up ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), even if it is small, and he can include himself, his parents and his wife in that, such as contributing to the building of a mosque, or the digging of a well, or the setting up of a waqf (endowment) to help the needy, and the like. Note: With regard to what is mentioned in the question, “but her husband was able to pay the costs of Hajj for her,” we would like to point out that it is not obligatory for the husband to cover the costs of Hajj for his wife, even if he is rich. Rather that is recommended and he will be rewarded for it, and it comes under the heading of showing kindness to her. But if he does not do that, there is no sin on him.

Title: He committed an immoral act with his wife’s daughter

Question: He committed an immoral act with his wife’s daughter

Answer: 14/Sha'ban/1435 , 12/June/2014 87,730 Question : 199332 I am writing regarding a very delicate question, can you please answer me as soon as possible. What is the ruling regarding a person who has made the big mistake of having illicit relations with his step daughter, he has kissed, and had oral sex with her although no vaginal penetration has taken place. Is his Nikah with his wife still valid or not . Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: First of all, and before answering your question about the shar‘i ruling, the Muslim must always find out about repentance and its means. So he should strive hard to find out about things that will expiate sins and ask Allah for pardon, mercy and forgiveness. The consequences of sin are terrible in this world and the Hereafter, but if Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sees that the Muslim sincerely regrets what he has done, is determined to refrain from that sin in the future, and is sincere in seeking forgiveness and turning to Him, then He, may He be glorified and exalted, forgives sin, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them, (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82]. But if he persists and is arrogant, and continues in his sin as if nothing happened, then he will carry a burden on the Day of Resurrection. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment” [an-Nisa’ 4:14]. What this man and this girl must do is hasten to make up for their recklessness in committing these grave sins and immoral actions, and seek forgiveness from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. That cannot be achieved except by taking all possible measures to ensure that immoral actions do not occur again, by changing one’s place of residence, and avoiding mixing with his wife’s daughter, and keeping away from her altogether, so that seeing her will not prompt him to commit that sin again. This is the responsibility of both parties, and her mother – who is his wife – is also responsible. If they do not give due attention to the matter, and they do not keep far away from one another, the Shaytaan will tempt him again to fall into an even greater sin. With regard to the shar‘i ruling, it is also serious. The Hanafi fuqaha’ stated that if a man touches a girl with desire, then the mahram rulings regarding marriage immediately come into effect, even if no intercourse takes place. Whoever kisses a girl with desire, her mother and daughter become haraam to him and she becomes haraam to his sons. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in al-Musannaf (3/479-480) with his isnaads that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) undressed his slave woman, then one of his sons asked to marry her, and he said: She is not permissible for you. It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that he undressed one of his slave women, then one of his sons asked to marry her and he said: She is not permissible for you. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If a man undresses his slave woman, and looks at her with desire, she is not permissible for his son. As-Sarkhasi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We quote as evidence the reports of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – and he mentioned some of the reports quoted above – and because touching and kissing are a means that lead to intercourse, they are regarded as foreplay leading to it, so they have the same effect as intercourse itself in establishing the mahram relationship, just as the marriage contract, which is a means for legitimate intercourse, has the same effect in establishing the mahram relationship, except in the case where the text states otherwise, namely that of a stepdaughter. That is because the mahram relationship is based on precautions; therefore anything that could lead to intercourse may have the same effect with regard to the mahram relationship as intercourse itself, and that is as a precautionary measure, even though it has no effect on other rulings. End quote from al-Mabsoot (4/206) Ibn al-Humaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man touches a woman with desire, her mother and daughter become haram for him, because touching and looking are means that lead to intercourse, so they are regarded as having the same effect, as a precaution. End quote from Fath al-Qadeer (3/2210) Moreover, the Hanafi fuqaha’ have ruled that the marriage is annulled because of touching with desire in such cases, as Ibn Nujaym (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In the case of a woman who is observing ‘iddah following a revocable divorce (first or second talaaq), if she allows her husband’s son to be intimate with her, or he kisses her with desire, then she is not entitled to any maintenance, because the separation did not occur as a result of talaaq, rather it occurred as a result of an action on her part, which is the sin she committed. End quote from al-Bahr ar-Raa’iq (4/218) Az-Zayla‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Zina, touching and looking with desire result in in-laws becoming prohibited for marriage … The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever touches a woman with desire”, her mother and daughter become haraam for him. This is the view of ‘Umar, ‘Imraan ibn al-Husayn, Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah, Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, ‘Aa’ishah, Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn ‘Abbaas and the majority of the Taabi‘een. End quote from Tabyeen al-Haqaa’iq (2/106) We do not deny that a number of scholars stated that the mahram relationship only comes into effect as a consequence of intercourse within the framework of a valid, legitimate shar‘i marriage. Some of them said that intimacy and the like does not have any effect of creating a mahram relationship. Others said that the mahram relationship cannot be created, even as a result of intercourse, except within the framework of a valid marriage. Shaykh ad-Dardeer al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a man who has committed zina with a woman to marry her ascendants and descendants, and for his father or son to marry her. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Kabeer ma‘a Haashiyat ad-Dasooqi (2/251) Ibn Hajar al-Haytami ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Intimate actions are not like intercourse, according to the more correct view, because they do not require ‘iddah, so by the same token they do not result in creation of the mahram relationship. Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/303) Al-Bahooti al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no proof that the mahram relationship is created as a result of intimacy or looking at the private part or elsewhere, or by being alone with the person, even with desire, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them” [an-Nisa’ 4:23]. What is meant by “going in” is intercourse. The same applies if she is the one who did that, i.e., what is mentioned above of intimacy, looking at the private part or elsewhere, and being alone with a man, with desire. Her daughter does not become haram for him, because he did not have intercourse with her mother. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (5/71) This has been discussed previously, and we stated which view is more likely to be correct. See 131569 But no one would say, and no wise person would accept it, that the husband should remain in that situation, exposing himself to the risk of falling into sin and immoral deeds, without closing the door to it. Would this husband be happy to be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) with the adulterers and adultresses, and to receive the same punishment as them, of which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke when he said: “…we came to something like a tannoor (clay oven), in which there was shouting and voices. We looked inside and saw naked men and women, towards whom flames came from beneath them. When the flames reached them, they cried out” then he stated that they were “the adulterers and adulteresses”, as is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (7047). Undoubtedly, if your marriage to your wife is not annulled, then leaving things as they are and continuing to live with her daughter in the same house, with the possibility of being alone with her, is one of the gravest of evils and opens wide the door to falling into immoral deeds and incurring the wrath of the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Your transgression of the sacred limits set by Allah is worse than mere annulment of the marriage. If someone were to ask, does a wife become haraam for her husband if he kills her daughter, the answer would be: No. But annulment of the marriage, or its being haraam from the outset is one thing, and the abhorrent nature of the crime is something else. So think: where are you, O slave of Allah, and where is your religious commitment? How could you allow yourself to drift away from religion and be overtaken by your desires?? If you stay in your marriage to this woman, it is not permissible for you to continue in that immoral action. This is quite clear. But, moreover, it is not permissible for you to stay with the door to fitnah wide open in front of you. Rather you must keep away from fitnah and its causes, with all means at your disposal, and you must block every route that calls you to be tempted by this girl and to go back to what you both did. What you must do is take precautions and protect your religious commitment, not only by repenting from those reprehensible actions, but also by closing the door to anything that could make you go back to it. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Give up riba and doubtful things.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2276); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to protect Muslim families from immoral actions, both obvious and hidden. And Allah knows best. Reference close Source : Islam Q&A Have feedback about this content?

Title: Ruling on working in a job selling counterfeit clothing and paying a bribe to bring it into the country

Question: Ruling on working in a job selling counterfeit clothing and paying a bribe to bring it into the country

Answer: 01/Rabi al-awwal/1444 , 27/September/2022 10,602 Question : 199307 I work in the field of trade and import with a shipping agent. This agent brings these particular goods in by means of bribery. Please note that the goods in question are counterfeit clothes bearing the logos of internationally-know brands such as Lacoste and Adidas, and that is not allowed. Is my business halaal or haraam? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: If these items of clothing are sold on the basis that they are manufactured by those internationally-known brands with those famous logos, when in fact that is not the case, then selling them and dealing in them is deceiving and cheating the purchasers. All of that is prohibited according to the teachings of our religion. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102). The matter becomes more sinful if they are brought into the country by unlawful means and haraam bribes that are paid in order to bring them in. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/73): It is not permissible to sell counterfeit goods claiming that they are original, and it is not permissible to deal in them or distribute them to shops, because that comes under the heading of deceiving the Muslims, lying and defrauding them… and because that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression, and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Maa’idah 5:2] {And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly} [al-Baqarah 2:188]. Moreover, that also causes harm to those who sell the original, non-counterfeit goods, and is competing unlawfully with them. Based on that, selling these goods without informing the purchaser that they are counterfeit is haraam and is a cause of blessing (barakah) being erased from one’s business dealings. End quote. Therefore what you must do is stop dealing in these fraudulent clothes, whether you are selling them or helping to bring them into the country by any means, because this comes under the heading of helping in sin and transgression. We ask Allah to make it easy for you to find another way of doing lawful business. And Allah knows best. Reference close Source : Islam Q&A Have feedback about this content? Was this answer helpful?

Title: She saw a brownish discharge on the day after her had period ended and she had done ghusl, and she did not pay any attention to it, then she did another ghusl, and now she is not sure whether her ghusl and prayer were valid

Question: She saw a brownish discharge on the day after her had period ended and she had done ghusl, and she did not pay any attention to it, then she did another ghusl, and now she is not sure whether her ghusl and prayer were valid

Answer: 14/Ramadan/1435 , 11/July/2014 57,825 Question : 199263 During the month of Ramadan, I got my monthly period, which lasted for five days. At dawn on the sixth day, I did ghusl so that I could fast. That was on September 30. I do not remember whether I saw the tuhr (white discharge signalling the end of menses) or not, because I was thinking so much that I forgot. What matters is that at 8 o’clock in the morning I did wudoo’ so that I could pray Duha, and I saw a light reddish-brown colour. I thought that it was the brownish discharge because I have read something about its description, and I did not pay any further attention to it, and I completed the fast of that day. Please note that I did not see anything else after that, and the following day was ‘Eid. I did ghusl for ‘Eid as usual, without any intention of purification. My question is: If I was still impure on that day, then is the ghusl I did on the day of ‘Eid valid, or were my prayer, fasting and other acts of worship in the months of Shawwaal invalid, until the menses of Dhu’l-Qa‘dah came? Answer Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah: Firstly: The end of menses is known by one of two signs. The first is cessation of bleeding and drying up of the place, such that if a woman were to insert a piece of cotton and the like, it will come out clean with no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge on it. The second sign is passing of the white discharge; some women do not see this discharge. Secondly: Passing of brownish or yellowish discharge after purification or end of the menses is not regarded as menses, so your fast is valid, because Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We did not regard brownish or yellowish discharge after the period ended as being anything that mattered.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (307); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. For more information please see the answer to question no. 50059 Thirdly: The fact that the questioner did ghusl and fasted on the basis that she had become pure following the end of her menses, and the fact that she forgot that, should be paid no heed, on the basis that this is what you are certain about, and so as to close the door to waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan). Fourthly: If we assume that you had been too hasty in doing ghusl and fasting, and that on that day you had not yet become pure, then you did ghusl for ‘Eid after your menses finished, but with the intention of doing ghusl for Eid, not for the end of menses, then your purification is also valid, in sha Allah, and you do not have to repeat the purification or the prayer. This is the view of the Hanbalis and this is what will make things easier for you, especially in a situation such as yours, so as to ward off waswaas and doubts concerning purification. It says in Mataalib Ooli an-Nuha (1/111): Whoever intends to do a Sunnah ghusl – such as ghusl for Jumu‘ah or Eid – it is valid as an obligatory ghusl, if he had forgotten (about the obligatory ghusl), to remove impurity that made ghusl obligatory. End quote. Al-Hajjaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zaad al-Mustaqni‘: If he intended to do a Sunnah ghusl, that is valid as an obligatory ghusl. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: An example is if a person does ghusl after washing a deceased person (prior to burial), or he does ghusl for ihram, or to stand in ‘Arafah. These ghusls are Sunnah. The same applies to ghusl for Jumu‘ah, according to the majority of scholars. What the words of the author [al-Hajjaawi] appear to mean – which is also our view – is: if he remembers that he has to do an obligatory ghusl. Some of our companions limited that to the case where he forgets that he is impure or junub. If he had not forgotten, then (the obligatory ghusl) is not waived, because the Sunnah ghusl is not done to remove impurity of janaabah, and if this is the case, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions”, and this man did not intend to do anything but a Sunnah ghusl, but he was aware that he was in a state of janaabah and remembered that, so how can the impurity have been removed? This view – which limits this ruling to cases where the person has forgotten – makes a valid point. The reasoning of the madhhab is that because the Sunnah ghusl is a prescribed means of purification, it does remove the impurity )of janaabah). But this argument is problematic, because it is undoubtedly a ghusl that is prescribed in sharee‘ah, but it is of lesser status than obligatory ghusl in the case of janaabah, so how can a Sunnah action be so strong that it can take the place of something that is obligatory and of a higher standing? But if he had forgotten, then he is excused. For example, if a person does ghusl for Jumu‘ah on the basis that it is Sunnah, but he was in a state of janaabah, but he did not remember, or he was not aware of being in a state of janaabah until after the prayer, such as if he had a wet dream but did not realise until after the prayer, then his Jumu‘ah prayer is valid because the janaabah had been removed. But if he knew about it and intended this ghusl to be Sunnah only, then the view that it is still valid (to remove janaabah) is something questionable. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (1/201) From the shaykh’s words it is clear that ignorance of what makes ghusl obligatory comes under the same ruling as forgetting, so his purification by means of a mustahabb ghusl is valid. And Allah knows best. Reference close Source : Islam Q&A Have feedback about this content? Was this answer helpful? Yes No
